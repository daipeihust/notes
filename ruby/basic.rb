# Everything, including a literal, is an object, so this works:
-199.abs                                                # 199
"ruby is cool".length                                   # 12
"Rick Astley".index("c")                                # 2
"Nice Day Isn't It?".downcase.split(//).sort.uniq.join  # " '?acdeinsty"
